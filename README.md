<b>Single page app</b>

This is a single page app that displays products. All content is loaded right off the bat, only one http request.

Default hash is #frozen.
Links default actions on click prevented.
Content pushed into the empty "app" div in the markup according to current hash.

Explanation is in comments in the app.js


<b>Single page app 2</b>
Since the other app only used the location web api, I decided to follow a tutorial and include
a smaller project using the history web api (push/pop state funcs) to do a similar thing.
